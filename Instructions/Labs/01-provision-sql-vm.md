# Provision a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine

Students will explore the Azure Portal and use it to create an Azure VM with SQL Server 2019 installed. Then they will connect to the virtual machine through Remote Desktop Protocol.

You are a database administrator for AdventureWorks. You need to create a test environment for use in a proof of concept. The proof of concept will use SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine and a backup of the AdventureWorksDW database. You need to set up the Virtual Machine, restore the database, and query it to ensure it is available.

## Deploy a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine

1. On the Azure portal locate the search bar at the top of the page. Search for **Azure SQL (1)**. Select the search result for **Azure SQL (2)** that appears in the results under **Services**.

    >**Note**: you can also configure the storage for your SQL Server VM on this screen. By default, the SQL Server Azure VM templates create one premium disk with read caching for data, one premium disk without caching for transaction log, and uses the local SSD (D:\ on Windows) for tempdb.

1. Select the **Review + create** button. Then select **Create**.

1. On the deployment blade, wait until the deployment is complete. The VM will take approximate 5-10 minutes to deploy. After the deployment is complete, select  **Go to resource**.
